## **2\. WHY GCMS?**

The displacement of people into small, crowded areas like refugee or IDP (Internally Displaced Persons) camps significantly affects the ability of NGOs and humanitarian organizations to deliver aid effectively.

### **The Impact of Displacement and Overcrowded Camps on Humanitarian Operations**

When large populations are suddenly displaced due to conflict, natural disaster, or political instability, they often end up in makeshift camps or temporary shelters that are overcrowded and under-resourced. These conditions create **complex operational challenges** for NGOs and aid organizations trying to deliver timely, effective assistance.

#### **1\. Lack of Accurate and Up-to-Date Data**

* **Problem:** Aid workers often don’t know exactly *who* is in the camp — their names, family units, medical conditions, or needs.

* **Impact:** This makes it difficult to assess the scale of the crisis, prioritize the most vulnerable (e.g., children, elderly, people with disabilities), or plan effectively for food, water, medical supplies, and shelter.

#### **2\. Overcrowding and Unclear Camp Layouts**

* **Problem:** Camps are often set up quickly without a clear layout or system for tracking locations of families or individuals.

* **Impact:** Aid delivery becomes chaotic. Staff may struggle to find individuals, leading to duplication (some people receive aid multiple times) while others receive nothing.

#### **3\. Rapid Population Changes**

* **Problem:** People may move in and out of camps frequently, especially in conflict zones or unstable areas.

* **Impact:** Static records (e.g., paper lists) become outdated almost instantly. Without real-time tracking, it's impossible to maintain accurate distribution records or plan long-term support.

#### **4\. Vulnerable Groups Are Easily Overlooked**

* **Problem:** People with disabilities, special needs, or chronic conditions are not always visibly identifiable.

* **Impact:** Without a system to flag and track these individuals, they risk being excluded from essential services like medical care, mobility aids, or specialized food.

#### **5\. Logistical Complexity in Aid Distribution**

* **Problem:** Limited space, crowding, and lack of infrastructure make it hard to set up organized distribution points.

* **Impact:** This can lead to long queues, confusion, missed distributions, and even conflict among camp residents.

#### **6\. Poor Coordination Among Agencies**

* **Problem:** Multiple NGOs often operate in the same area but with limited coordination or data sharing.

* **Impact:** Overlapping efforts waste resources, and critical gaps remain unaddressed. A unified data system can help synchronize efforts and close these gaps.

## **3\. How a Centralized System Like GCMS Helps?**

Implementing a centralized, digital camp management system like GCMS allows humanitarian organizations to:

* Maintain **accurate, up-to-date records** of camp residents.

* Track **family units**, **special needs**, and **location within the camp**.

* Facilitate **coordinated aid delivery** with less duplication and more equitable distribution.

* Use **data and reporting** to plan for future needs and respond to changes quickly.

* Ensure **inclusion and protection** of the most vulnerable individuals.

## **4\. Challenges and Obstacles**

* **Weak internet connection** \- Affects communication and completing tasks on time.

* **Different availability among team members** \- Difficulty in coordination and teamwork due to mismatched schedules.

* **Need to learn new things** \- Extra time required to learn new tools and technologies before implementation.

* **Displacement and bombing conditions** \- Critical circumstances affecting focus, safety, mental health, and work continuity.
